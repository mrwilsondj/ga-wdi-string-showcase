Please contribute. We are using the git-flow process. http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/. 
Please conform.:

* Make feature branches that begin with your initials, ie: JR_newfeaturename.
* Add basic tests before merging into develop. 
* Pull from develop, resolve merge conflicts, and re-test before attempting to integrate your feature.
* Do not merge into master until the primary collaborators do a code review.
