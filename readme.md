This is a student showcase. We want to do something very similar to this one - http://wdi3.github.io/

### Git Workflow Branch
Please contribute. If you want to be added as a collaborator, please ask (john@johnrandall.com). We are using the git-flow process. (see http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) 
Please conform:

* Make feature branches that begin with your initials, ie: JR_newfeaturename. 

* Add basic tests before merging into develop. 

* Pull from develop, resolve merge conflicts, and re-test before attempting to integrate your feature.

* Do not merge into master. The primary collaborators will merge after a code review.

### Content
All data is in the seed file. 

**If you want to be listed on the site** but not otherwise contribute, then fork this project, add a student model and project models to the seed file, and submit a pull request.
